# Cogeneration-Thermodynamic-Cycle-Analysis-App
This app lets you analyze certain parameters of a cogeneration cycle

This app was made for a Thermodynamics Project for the course MEC 514 Applied Thermodynamics.
The cycle the program is modelling is as follows:

The cycle shematic was created by other members of the group.

The app that I created was meant to be used as a way to easily modify critical parameters of the cycle and generate the corresponding T-s diagram to determine ideal
operating parameters. It was also meant to speed up and simplify the process of determining the parameters compared to doing calculations by hand or Excel.

A youtube video of the app in action can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b55LDxKEYMQ

NOTE: For this app to work, you must have the XSteam library installed.
